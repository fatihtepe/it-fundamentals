Questions:
1. Write a query that displays InvoiceId, CustomerId and total dollar amount for each invoice, sorted first by CustomerId (in ascending order), and then by total dollar amount  (in descending order).

2. Write a query that displays InvoiceId, CustomerId and total dollar amount for each invoice, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by CustomerId (in ascending order).

3. Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different when you switch the column you sort on first? (Explain it in your own words.)

4. Write a query to pull the first 10 rows and all columns from the invoices table that have a dollar amount of total greater than or equal to 10.

5. Write a query to pull the first 5 rows and all columns from the invoices table that have a dollar amount of total less than 10.

6. Find all track names that start with 'B' and end with 's'.

7. Use the invoices table to find all information regarding invoices whose billing address is USA or Germany or Norway or Canada and invoice date is at any point in 2010, sorted from newest to oldest.



1. SELECT InvoiceId, CustomerId, total
   FROM invoices
   ORDER BY CustomerId, total DESC;


2. SELECT InvoiceId, CustomerId, total
   FROM invoices
   ORDER BY total DESC, CustomerId;


3. The two queries above are almost same. The only difference is their order.
    For the first query is to see the customerid order is more important but for the second
    query is to see the highest amount is more important. It is just related with the preferences.

4. SELECT *
   FROM invoices
   WHERE Total >= 10 
   LIMIT 10;


5. SELECT *
   FROM invoices
   WHERE Total < 10 
   LIMIT 5;

6. SELECT *
   FROM tracks
   WHERE name 
   LIKE 'B%S';


7. SELECT *
   FROM invoices
   WHERE BillingCountry IN ('USA', 'Germany', 'Norway', 'Canada') 
   AND InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2011-01-01 00:00:00'  
   ORDER BY InvoiceDate DESC;
